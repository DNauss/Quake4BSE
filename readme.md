Quake 4 BSE 

The BSE system in Quake 4 and Quake Wars was a more advanced particle engine then what shipped in
Doom 3. The demo for Enemy Territory Quake Wars shipped with the PDB file for the demo win32 executable.
The Quake Wars SDK shipped with the BSE header files. This project is designed to re-create the missing
BSE cpp files using IDA pro and the ETQW pdb file.
